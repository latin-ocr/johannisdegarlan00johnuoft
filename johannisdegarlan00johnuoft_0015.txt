INTRODUCTION. vii

of his visit at this time we do not know3 but, as he speaks in the
following poem of the arguments he had used against the heretics,³
he was probably employed in some way or other in the crusade
against the Albigeois. A few years afterwards, on the final submis-
sion of count Raymond of Toulouse by the treaty of April 1229, the
University of Toulouse was founded under the auspices of the legate
Romanus de Sancto Angelo. John de Garlande was one of the pro-
fessors selected by the legate from the University of Paris to be sent
thither to assist in its formation, and he gives us an account of their
journey in company with Elie abbot of Grandselve, one of the
negociators of the treaty, with a rather emious and interesting notice
of the first beginning of the southern university.² He tells us in
another passage that, in the same year, finding that the people (the
clergy) of Toulouse were at fault in their reckoning of the time for
celebrating Easter, he gave them rules for that pm·pose.³

He further informs us that he remained three years in the Um·-
versity of Toulouse, and gives us an account of the studies pursued
there3 that he wrote and revised there his ,Epithalcmzizmz Beatoe
Marioe Virqim's, a poem contained in the same Manuscript from
which we print the poem De Triumphis Ecclesice, and which he
says he presented to the legate at Beziers; ⁴ and that, during his
stay at Toulouse, an Italian scholar of great learning, named
Roland, came to Toulouse and confuted a heretical teacher named
Gauvaine, causing either hini or his writings to be burnt.5 We
know that the legate Romanus went to Toulouse in the No-
vember of 1229, to hold a council there, at which the power of
the Inquisition was established throughout Languedoc. At length,
John de Garlande tells us, after the death of the sanguinary
bishop of Toulouse, Folquet de Marseilles (which occurred at the
Christmas of 1231), the university began to decline, the pro-
fessors no longer received the irregular salaries assured to them
