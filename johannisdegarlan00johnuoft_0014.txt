vi INTRODUCTION.

John of London lectured on natural philosophy. Like many of
his contemporaries, John (16 Garlande‚ in his eagerness for know-
ledge, left his native country to settle in Paris, and in the uni-
versity there he attended among others the teaching of Alanus de
Insulis, of whom also he relatcs an anecdote which was not, Ι
think, known before.¹ From another poem by John de Garlande‚
it appears that he was in the university of Paris as early as the
year 1204ss Fra-nce had now become his adopted country; and he
speaks of it with feelings of attachment which he acknowledges to
have been as great if not greater than those he entertained for his
native country.³ We learn from another of his works, a sort of

'² The poem alludcd tc is the Carmen. (Ze Officiis Ecclesiae, of which there is a copy in
0116 of the Cottonian Mannscripts (MS. Cotton. Claudius A. v111.). At the close of this
poem, fol. 210, v'3.7 the writer says——

“ Hoc opus exiguum ludendo tempore feri
Exiguo quod Pafisius praecone relatum
Conscripsere manus, studium quo tempore mortem
Flevit Alexandri studiosi carmine tali.
Gemma pudicitiae fuit hic, ilos philosophiae,
Aula decens morum redolens velut area florum,
Quem virtus humilis rexit⁷ qui vultus honestus
Promsit pacificum, doctum, rationis amicum3
Floret Alexandro locus hic, dedit Anglia florem,
Cujus Parisius caelo transmisit odorem.
Mille ducentenis quater inde delegat annis
Virginis'a partu, qui nos censura J ohannis
Missam legatus pro defuncto celebravit, &cz-'⁷
