xii INTRODUCTION.

of his works were desig-ned for purposes of instruction. Such were
the Dietionarius already mentioned, the Compendium Grammatieoe,
and the Aecentuarimn, all three found in a manuscript in Caius
College‚ Cambridge ; the Synonymorum opus, which was printed by
Pynsoin and the Αἅβραἱυοσονῑωη opus, which was also printed by
Pynson. He was the author of several other poems, chiefly of a
religious character; but he seems to have considered as his two
most excellent works the Epithalamium B. sz'oe Virffl'nz's, and
the poeni now printed, De Triumphis Ecclesice. They are both con-
tained in a very carefully written manuscript of the latter part of
the thirteenth century, preserved in the British Museum (MS.
Cotton. Claudius A. X.)‚ from which the text in the present volume
is edited. Ι am not aware that any other manuscript of this poem
is known to exist.
