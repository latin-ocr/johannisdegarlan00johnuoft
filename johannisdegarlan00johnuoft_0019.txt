INTRODUCTION. xi

Gai-lande chose to consider this history as a succession of trimnphs
of the Chureh3 and he, therefore, selected forits title that of De
Triumplm‘s Ecclesioe. This title has, to a certain degree, been un-
favourable to his fame, for it has led the readers of old manuscripts
to pass his book over as a mere theologica] poem, and thus its many
curious illustrations of contemporary history were overlooked.

The style of John de Garlande is ambitious and pedantic, and
displays the schoolman vain of his accomplishments. His languagQ
though now and then we have a few good lines, is far inferior to
that of the scholastic Latin poets of the preceding century, and is
full of grammatica] conceits and puns, and plays upon words and
rhymes. Its author affeetS, above all things, a great facility in the
use of all the quaint and fantastical embellishments of Latin metre
which were then practised by the ingenious, and he carries this so
far as to introduce on occasions what were termcd in scholastic
language versus retroqradi, or verses which read backwards as well
as forwards.¹ These defects of style often render the meaning
obscure, while, as a whole, the poem is broken, and confused
by frequent digressions, the principal object of which appears to
have been to make a display of the author’s varied knowledge in
theology, in history, in literature, and in the sciences, such as
astronomy, mathematics, navigation, natural philosophy, and even
medicine.² He even on one occasion treats us with a page or two
of popular prognostics of the weather.³ Making allowance for
these defects, the poem is interesting in many points of view; it is
a remarkable monument of the lighter scholastic literature of the
age; it is ful] of allusions to contemporary events, given in a tone
which eonveys to us more of the general sentiment of the time
than We gain from the chroniclers ; and even the digressions are
sometimes reflections of the popular feehngs of those for whom

John de Garlande wrote.
