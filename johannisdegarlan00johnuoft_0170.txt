NOTES.

young, was introduced to the notice of Clotaire Π. king of the Franks, by his
treasurer Bobo. Clotaire gave him a commission to make him a rich chair of
state3 and, as was usual, supplied him with the materiale, which Eligius turned to
so much advantage that, in place of keeping the materials which were superfluous,
he brought the king two chairs instead of one. Clotaire was so much pleased
with his honesty as well as with his skffl, that he made him master of his minu
and Eligius became the confidentia] minister of Clotaire as well as of his successor
Dagobert.

known to need explanation.

P. 39, 1. 3. Martinus. St. Martin of Tours, whose family were pagam, and who himself

served in the Roman army as a soldier, once met with a miserable beggar who
was half-naked and shivering in the cold. As he had already given away 311 1115
money in charity‚ he took off 1115 rich eloah, and, cutting it in two with his sword,
gave one half to the beggar to cover him more war-my, and wrapped the other
round his own body.

l. 5. Gudlaco. The struggles of St. Guthlac with the demons, who strove to expel

him from his residence at Croyland, are told at length in his life by Felix of
Croyland.

P. 40, l. 7. In Frontineium. The poet, after another digression, reverts again to the war

in Poitou. Frontineium‚ called by Mat-thew Paris Castrum de F rontenay, is called
by the French chroniclers‚ more correcssy, Fontenay. It was in fact Fontenay‚
near Niort, now called Rohan-Rohan. It seems to have been known by both
names of Fontenay and Frontenay; for it is evident by his pun on the word
(frontem), that John de Garlande, who must have been well acquainted with the
French pronunciation, intended to write it F rontineium. The siege of F ontenay
was one os the grand events of this war.
