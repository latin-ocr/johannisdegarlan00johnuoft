INTRODUOTION.

ι101111 DE GARLANDE (or Garlandie, for the Latinized form would
seem to point to the latter as his true name), the author of the
following poem, has been among English and foreign literary his-
torians the subject of much confusion, with rcgard both to his age
and to his country. The more important errors arose chiefly
from confounding our poet with 1110 mathematician Gerlandus,
who flourished in France in the eleventh century, and who was best
known by his treatise on the emporus, or C'omputus. The mistake
18, however, the less excusablc, as our John de Garlande not
unfrequently speaks of himself in 1118 writings, especially in 1110 0110
now printed for 1110 first time.

Thus, he tells us expressly that 110 w¹‘as an Ε113118111111111.1 We
have no means of ascertaining the exact date ofi his birth, but it no
doubt took place at some period in the latter half of the twelfth
century. He tells us that when a youth he studied at Oxford, and
that he attended there the lectures of John of London, of whom 110
gives a short but interesting account.2 From this it appears that

² See pp. 53, 54. Tanner mentions two English scholars named John of London, the

first a professor at Oxford, and the friend of Roger Bacon, the other a monk of Canter-
bury⁷ in the fourteenth century, who wrote chronicles. The latter, of course, is out of
the question 3 and the former is much too late in date to be identical with him of whom
John de Ga1·lande speaks, and who must, therefore, be considered as an addition to our
known list of English scholars of the middle ages. I suspect, however, that Leland, from
whom Tanner copies⁷ has taken some of the allusions to our John of London as belonging

to the contemporary of Bacon.
