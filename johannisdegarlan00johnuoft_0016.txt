by the treaty of 1229, and the “crowd” of students gradually
dispersed.¹ The principa] cause of this change appears to have
been the unsettled state of the country, for the violence of the
French governors and the atrocities committed by the inquisitors
had produced everywhere a spirit of resistance, and the more reso-

hiding places, and in some of the castles and strongholds, where
they were probably joined by many who only sought the oppor-

general desertion of the University of Toulouse was the consequence.

outlaws, who had established themselves in the strong fortress of
Castel—Sarrasin, in the neighbourhood of Moissac, whither they were
carrying them as prisoners. Some extraordinary appearance in the
heavens, however, ari-ested the attention of their capt0rs‚ and before
they could land at Moissac a party of pilgrims arrived opportunely
to their rescue (pereffl‘ini, meaning probably the Freneh soldiers
who had assumed the cross in the crusade against the Albigeois).
This appears to have occurred at night, for we are told that at,
daybreak (erasum lua: oritur) the outlaws lauded and plundered
and burnt the houses (of MoissacP), and then, as it appears,
